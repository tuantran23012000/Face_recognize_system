# FRS

## Face_recognize_system

This project contains my work that target on solving some problems of FRS:
- Face detection: [Retinaface](https://github.com/biubug6/Pytorch_Retinaface)
- Face anti-spoofing: [Fourier transform](https://github.com/minivision-ai/Silent-Face-Anti-Spoofing)
- Face embedding: [Insightface](https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface)
- Face quality: [EQface](https://github.com/deepcam-cn/FaceQuality)
